# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The provider allows to create multiple databases on a single PostgreSQL server instance.

The use cases include providing databases for development, testing, demo, learning
and other sandbox environments where you don't have critical load and just need an isolated databse.

Running multiple databases on a single PostgreSQL server instance allows to save on resources.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider.tf" }}
