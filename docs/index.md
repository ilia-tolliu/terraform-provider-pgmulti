# PGMULTI Provider

The provider allows to create multiple databases on a single PostgreSQL server instance.

The use cases include providing databases for development, testing, demo, learning
and other sandbox environments where you don't have critical load and just need an isolated databse.

Running multiple databases on a single PostgreSQL server instance allows to save on resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright (c) HashiCorp, Inc.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    pgmulti = {
      source  = "ilia-tolliu/pgmulti"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "pgmulti" {
  # Nothing to configure
}

# Create a database on a running PostgreSQL instance
resource "pgmulti_db" "example" {
  hostname        = "localhost"
  port            = 5432
  master_username = "root"
  master_password = "12345"
  db_name         = "example_db"
}
```

## Configuration

The provider does not require any additional configuration.
